// Draw that stroke directly onto a ‚Äúbase layer‚Äù (commit it to the canvas permanently).
// Take a snapshot of the canvas (an ImageBitmap).
// Clear out the old strokes ‚Äî they‚Äôre no longer needed for redraws because the base layer already contains them.
// Now your canvas only needs to draw: Live strokes (current in-progress stroke) : The snapshot of all previous strokes
// This means no more replaying hundreds/thousands of old strokes.
// Old strokes are flattened ‚Üí no need to replay them.
// Undo/redo swaps snapshots instantly.

// the DrawingEngine is designed to handle all low-level drawing operations on the canvas.

    // So any function calling createImageBitmap must be async to use await.

    // By marking these functions as async, i Allow the browser to split the work into smaller chunks. Let the event loop handle UI updates and other events in-between operations. Prevent freezing when restoring or committing large canvas states. Even if your current implementation doesn‚Äôt have big delays yet, this design prepares for future scalability.
    // later i might want to save snapshots to disk or IndexedDB (both async APIs).
    // Load huge images asynchronously.
    // createImageBitmap is preferred over ctx.getImageData() because: It uses GPU memory instead of CPU memory. It avoids transferring tons of pixel data back and forth to JS land. And, most importantly, it‚Äôs non-blocking.
