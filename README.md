A paint app for you to draw whatever is in your mind, designed to be easy and enjoyable to use.

### Reasons behind the project

I created this project because a loved microsoft paint when i was a kid, so i wanted to create a mordernized version of it, easier to use, being able to undo more than three actions and increase the pencil size as much i want

Another reason is that i wanted to challenge myself and create a hybrid project that uses react for the UI and pure TypeScript for the drawing logic to see if i could connect both parts together. it was hard but worth it.


### Philosofy for this app

Splash Paint was designed with drawing freedom in mind, altough its features are simple you can draw pretty much anything with it.


### Features

pencil: you can increase it as much as you like there is no limit of size you can change the stroke style, instead of circle you can use square producing different effects in the drawing

eraser: basically a pencil but you can earaser the drawing with it, you can change its stroke style as well

shapes: one of the most fun features if you want to build drawings with well defined borders or just mess around with the shapes

undo/redo : it has a undo redo function that allows you to undo up to 20 actions

trash/delete all: you can clean the canvas completely

download button: Allows you to download you drawing, after all it wouldn't be fun to draw in it if you can't keep your drawing.
