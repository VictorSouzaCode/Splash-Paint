A paint app for you to draw whatever is in your mind, designed to be easy and enjoyable to use.

### Reasons behind the project

I created this project because a loved microsoft paint when i was a kid, so i wanted to create a mordernized version of it, easier to use, being able to undo more than three actions and increase the pencil size as much i want

Another reason is that i wanted to challenge myself and create a hybrid project that uses react for the UI and pure TypeScript for the drawing logic to see if i could connect both parts together later. it was hard but worth it.
